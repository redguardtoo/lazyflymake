* lazyflymake
Lightweight syntax checker for Emacs, alternative of =flymake-mode=.

It's does less CPU computing and costs less memory than its rivals.

In below screenshot, this program is tested in both Emacs 26 and Emacs 25 (left side is Emacs 26, right side is Emacs 25),

* Install
Place =*.el= under [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Search.html][Load Path]]. Then add =(require 'lazyflymake)= to your configuration.
* Usage
This program is based on =flymake= API. So your existing configuration for =flymake= still works.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'lazyflymake-start)
#+end_src

By default, =flymake-mode= is turned on in =lazyflymake-start=. You could keep using all the commands from flymake.

Use =lazyflymake-goto-next-error= and =lazyflymake-goto-prev-error= to locate errors.

There is also a light weight mode which does not use =flymake-mode=.

Enable it by insert extra one line set up,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq lazyflymake-flymake-mode-on nil)
#+end_src

So =flymake-mode= is not turned on by =lazyflymake-start= automatically.

The syntax check happens *if and only if current buffer is saved*.

An extra command =lazyflymake-list-errors= is provided in light weight mode.

Please note this program also set up flymake for Shell script, Emacs Lisp, and Lua automatically.

[[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck][Shellcheck]] is required to check shell script.

Lua executable is required to check Lua code.

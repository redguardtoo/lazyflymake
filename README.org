* lazyflymake
Lightweight syntax checker for Emacs, alternative of =flymake-mode=.

Less CPU computing and less memory footprint.

[[file:demo.png]]

Since version 0.5, only Emacs 27.1+ is supported.

* Install
Place =*.el= under [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Search.html][Load Path]]. Then add =(require 'lazyflymake)= to your configuration.
* Usage
This program is based on =flymake= API. So your existing configuration for =flymake= still works.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'lazyflymake-start)
#+end_src

By default, =flymake-mode= is turned on in =lazyflymake-start=.

Use =lazyflymake-goto-next-error= and =lazyflymake-goto-prev-error= to locate errors.

There is also a lightweight mode which does not use =flymake-mode=.

Enable it by insert extra one liner before calling =flymake-start=,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq lazyflymake-flymake-mode-on nil)
#+end_src

Then =flymake-mode= is not turned on by =lazyflymake-start= automatically.

The syntax check happens *if and only if current buffer is saved*.

The command =lazyflymake-list-errors= is provided in lightweight mode.

There are also other optional commands,
- =lazyflymake-stop= stops the checking process and uninstall running code in =after-save-hook= and turn off =flymake-mode=.
- =lazyflymake-check-current-buffer= always checks current buffer, ignoring other setup.

=lazyflymake-program-extra-args= contains extra arguments passed to linter cli program. It could be converted to buffer local variable.

* Tips
This program also sets up flymake for Shell script, Emacs Lisp, and Lua automatically,
- [[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck][Shellcheck]] is required to check shell script
- Lua executable is required to check Lua code
- [[https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit][MISS_HIT]] is required to check octave/matlab code
- [[http://www.html-tidy.org/][Tidy]] is require to check html code
- Customize =lazyflymake-ignore-error-function= to ignore errors extracted from linter output.
